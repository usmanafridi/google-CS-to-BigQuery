# Transferring data from Google Cloud Storage to a BigQuery Table:

<p> In this repo, a way to transfer your csv file from Cloud Storage to a table in BigQuery has been performed. By simply giving the path of the cloud storage, and levering the power to Pandas library to transfer the manipulated file(if necessary) to BigQuery, one can easily perform that task. But remeber that you must have Google Cloud SDK installed, and that you must have the required credentials to perform this taks. For privacy reasons, I have not given the path of my Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery table id. You have to insert your path in those field. </p>
